# SubsetMask

**SubsetMask** is a lightweight toolkit designed to help researchers subset Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics (SRT) data objectsâ€”such as those from **CosMx** and **Xenium** platforms. It can be applied to any transcriptomics dataset that includes spatial coordinate metadata (`x`, `y`), making it broadly useful across SRT technologies.
